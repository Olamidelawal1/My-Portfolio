                    <h3>My career so far</h3>
                    <p>Always up for a challenge and looking for ways to improve myself, I began my journey into tech few months back.
                    I registered for online classes where I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS afterwhich, I registered for Zuri where
                    I was able to improve my basic understanding about these programming languages and also learn about the version control 
                    system called <strong>Git</strong>. I am currently in the Stutern program and I particularly look forward to the 
                    classes on Javascript and deployment. Upon the completion of this program, I hope to be a well seasoned front
                    end web developer.
